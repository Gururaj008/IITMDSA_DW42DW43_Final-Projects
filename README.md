Out of 3 projects assigned , tried my hands on 2 projects namely,

1. Predicting Breast Cancer in a patient
2. Predicting Term deposit subscription by a customer

Steps involved:

1. initial findings from the data
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Finding the correlation between feature pairs and target
4. Finding the correlation between individual feature and target
5. Set the inital benchmark of metrics with original dataset
6. Perform feature scaling
7. perform Grid Search to find the best hyper parameters for the chosen models
8. Build the models
9. Compare the metrics
10. Plot the metrics
11. Find the best performing model for the given dataset
12. Justify the result

Jupyter notebook comprising of the code, Grid search and a comprehensive report on the project can be found in the respective folder.
